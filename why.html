            <h2>Why I prefer dogs over cats!</h2>
            <p> I prefer dogs over cats. This is because you can play with your dog as long as you want. But with cats they always want to sleep and never want to do anything fun. Another thing is that they always want to be petted and rubbed but cats won't really let you do that. Lastly dogs are just cooler and cuter in my opinion.
